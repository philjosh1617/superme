        <h2>
            <p>
                The University of Science and Technology
                 of Southern Philippines (USTP) is a
                  state university established on August
                 16, 2016, by virtue of Republic Act
                10919 through the amalgamation of 
                 the Mindanao University of Science 
                and Technology (MUST) in Cagayan de Oro
                 City, Misamis Oriental and the
                 Misamis Oriental State College of 
                 Agriculture and Technology (MOSCAT)
                 in Claveria, Misamis Oriental. It
                 is located in Northern Mindanao,
                 the Gateway to Mindanao, which
                 offers a strategic locational 
                 advantage for the institution
                 to train and develop students
                 from all the other regions.   
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Adhering to its general mandate to
                  primarily provide advanced education; 
                  higher technological, professional,
                 and advanced instruction; and advanced
                  research and extension work required 
                  for global competitiveness, the University
                  envisions becoming a nationally
                 recognized S&T University providing 
                 the vital link between education and 
                  the economy. As the university 
                  fulfills this mandate, it moves from
                  within its immediate context and
                  toward its larger international 
                  environment as the first and only
                  national university of science
                 and technology in the country. 
                  It will operate as such that it 
                  will have seamless knowledge and
                 collaboration with its stakeholders
                in the private and public
                sectors, the labor market,
                 business, and industry.  
                 <br>
                 <br>

                students; offer entrepreneurs 
                 the opportunity to maximize their

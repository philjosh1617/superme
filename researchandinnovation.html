               Bamboo products are globally recognized as 
             environmentally friendly and also exhibit
              excellent quality. The Bamboo Research 
              and Innovation Center (BRIC) envisions
             being the leading center for scientific
              innovation and commercialization of 
              bamboo in Mindanao. The institution aspires 
              to be an active partner for various industry
               stakeholders in sustainably pursuing the
               still unsaturated potential of bamboo in
              local, national, and global markets.
             The Bamboo Research and Innovation 
               Center is guided by the principle of 
               product innovation and good manufacturing
               practices.

            The Center for Biomass Energy (CBE) is developing
             sustainable solutions for our future. It is working
            to bridge the divide across science, engineering,
              and industry and bringing the experts that will
              focus on renewable energy technologies, mainly
             biomass, and rational energy use and efficiency.
            The Center also serves as a platform for
              researchers to work with its peers and offer 
             solutions to industries and companies through
              innovative research in biomass energy.

              The general objective of the Center of Artificial 
              Intelligence (CAI) is to primarily provide
              Artificial Intelligence education to faculty 
              and student researchers, conduct AI-related 
             research, and provide AI-related solutions to 
             industries and communities. The CAI aims to
               facilitate training/seminars on AI topics;
              facilitate the conduct of AI-related research;
              design, develop, and patent software/hardware
              products for transfer and commercialization;
              establish a Science and Technology Innovation
              (STI) ecosystem of Research and Development 
              Institutions (RDIs) and stakeholders; and
             provide access of equipment, facilities,
             and other resources to investors, 
              innovators, and researchers.

             The Center for Dairy Research and Innovation (CDRI) 
             focuses on research and innovation concerning forage and 
             pasture development, dairy nutrition and feeding, health
             and disease management, smart agriculture, and production
              systems. The Center provides researchers, faculty, students
             , industry, and producers with a broad-based platform for
             research, teaching, and extension activities. It promotes
              new research links and synergies across the commercial 
             supply chain. It also leads the development of research,
             teaching, and technology transfer programs that provide
              the dairy and forage industries with new tools and 
             techniques for healthy, sustainable, and efficient 
             production. The CDRIâ€™s primary emphasis is dairy cattle
             production. As such, it will serve as the heart of 
             the USTP Dairy Farm, the dairy farmers in the region,
            the faculty, and the agriculture students harnessing
             their skills in doing research.
